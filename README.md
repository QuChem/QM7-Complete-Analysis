# QM9-Complete-Analysis
This repository analyzes the QM9 dataset in a step-by-step manner. It explains how machine learning models have been applied to this dataset and more.

QM9 dataset is a subset of the GDB-17 dataset composed of 166 billion organic molecules. Each molecule can possess up to 9 heavy atoms including C, N, O, and F. The dataset can be either downloaded from http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#qm9 or https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1.
The dataset consists of the Coulomb matrix representation of molecules and the corresponding atomization energy values computed at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory.
