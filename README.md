# QM9-Complete-Analysis
This repository analyzes the QM9 dataset in a step-by-step manner. It explains how machine learning models have been applied to this dataset and more.

QM9 dataset is a subset of the GDB-13 dataset composed of 7165 molecules which contain up to 23 atoms. Each molecule can possess up to 9 heavy atoms including C, N, O, and S. The dataset can be either downloaded from http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#qm7 or https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1.
The dataset consists of the Coulomb matrix representation of molecules and the corresponding atomization energy values computed at the PBE0/tier2 level of theory.
